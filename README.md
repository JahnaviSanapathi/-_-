### Project Overview

This repository contains two Java-based projects:

1. **Student Grade Tracker:** A simple application that allows a teacher to input student grades and calculate their average, highest, and lowest scores.
2. **Simple Banking Application:** A basic banking system that demonstrates fundamental Java concepts through deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and exit functionalities.

### Student Grade Tracker

#### Description
This program utilizes arrays to store student grades. The teacher can input grades for multiple students, and the application calculates and displays the average, highest, and lowest scores for each student.

#### Usage
1. Compile and run the `StudentGradeTracker` class.
2. Enter the number of students.
3. Input the grades for each student.
4. The program will display the average, highest, and lowest scores for each student.

### Simple Banking Application

#### Description
This application simulates basic banking operations. Users can deposit, withdraw, and check their account balance.

#### Usage
1. Compile and run the `BankingApplication` class.
2. The application will display a menu with options for deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and exit.
3. Select the desired operation and follow the prompts.

### Future Enhancements
* **Student Grade Tracker:**
